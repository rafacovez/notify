## Disclaimer: Notify App is in Development Mode

Please note that the Notify app is currently in development mode, and as a result, you won't be able to use it directly by visiting [https://t.me/playlistNotificationBot](https://t.me/playlistNotificationBot) without reaching out to me first.

### Usage Instructions:

1. If you are interested in using the Notify app, contact me to be manually added to the whitelist. You can reach out to me through adanescollante@gmail.com to request access.
2. Once you have contacted me and your request has been approved, you will receive further instructions on how to access and use the Notify app.

I am actively working on getting the Notify app into production mode to eliminate the manual whitelist process. I have reached out to the Spotify Developer Team to expedite this transition.
